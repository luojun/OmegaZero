# Play to learn and learn to play

## Sensorimotor

- Play: move cursor around
- Play: touch something (i.e. mouse down)
- Play: release something (i.e. mouse up)
- Play: pick up something (only stones can be picked up)
- Play: drop something (release while holding something)
- Play: move something (only stones can be moved)
- Play: push the board around ...

## Getting into the conceptual territory

- Play: place something -- intentionally move a stone to a place
- Play: place stones in patterns such as in a line
- Play: place stones on intersections
- Play: place stones in cells
- Play: place stones in color patterns

- Play: use cursor to trace down a line
- Play: hide and seek -- hide a white stone behind a pile of black stones
- Play: putting all white stones on one side of the board and all black stoens on the other side

## Play and the rise of conceptual architecture: the case of spatial relations

- Spatial relations become the invariance group

- Learn to differentiate individual stones based on space ...

- Now we can specify the task of moving stones arounds ... in a goal oriented way ... with enough resilience and flexibility.
- Sequential decision making now ...
