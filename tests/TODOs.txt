# Tests:
#
# [x] config
# [ ] world construction
#     [ ] check existence of surfaces and sizes
#     [ ] check number of stones, number of lines, and number of agents
# [ ] sensorimotor loop
#     [ ] check dimension of rendered image
#     [ ] single agent world
#       [ ] move agent to corner of environment, check tactile feedback
#       [ ] move agent to cneter of board, check tactile feedback
#     [ ] single agent + single stone world
#       [ ] create stone black at a corner of the environment, check existence of stone at corner
#       [ ] move agent to that corner of the environment, check agent is at corner
#       [ ] pick up stone, check holding and tactile feedback
#       [ ] move to center of board, check stone location and agent location
#       [ ] release stone
#         [ ] check tactile feedback
#         [ ] check color of center of rendered image -- agent color
#       [ ] pick up stone again, check tactile feedback
#         [ ] check color of center of rendered image -- stone black
# [ ] timing
#     [ ] check the zero cycle case
#     [ ] check greater than zero cycles: elapsed time bigger than zero
#     [ ] check double cycles make time longer
# [ ] capture
#     [ ] single screenshot -- test existence and size of PNG
#     [ ] multiple screenshots -- test existence of a series of PNGs and their size
# [ ] headless
