### Varieties of Affordance Field

1. Visual latency

- Assume there is no delay between motion command and kinesthetic feedback.
- Correlate kinesthetic feedback and visual feedback to estimate latency of visual feedback.
- Very much like rhythmic finger sucking in babies.
- This could be a field where different places in the visual scene has different latency.

2. Visual orientation

- Assume motion command is in robot base coordinateas, as in a SCARA robot.
- Correlate kinesthetic feedback direction and visual feedback direction to estimate orientation.
- The visual orientation is part of the transformation between motion command coordinates and visual feedback coordinates.
- But this one could also be a field.
- Note that this is possibly co-dependent with 3 below.

3. Where am I?

- A visual field of where I am, a field with a single or possibly multiple activation peaks for where I could possibly be in the visual field.
- This one settles the visual locus of action.

4. Where to travel and when to arrive?

- This one settles the mapping of motion command to visual scene.
- Independently controlled 

5. How do I feel?

- Learn to trigger a tactile feedback change.

6. Where do I feel what?

- Alignment of tactile field and visual field

7. Where are the stones?

- Feature placing of stoneness.
